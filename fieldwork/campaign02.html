									<h1>Campaign #2</h1>
									<p>October-November 2023</p>
								</header>
								<p><a href="../images/C02_Map.jpg" class="image right"><img src="../images/C02_Map.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									On Wednesday 18 October 2023, we headed out to the field for the first day of the second campaign. The experiences of 
									the first campaign came in handy to access the selected sampling sites and organise the logistics of the field visits
									in an efficient manner. Surprisingly, the study area (and Ecuador in general) is facing the worst drought of the last
									four decades, causing the levels of the reservoirs to be exceptionally low. Also water levels within the rivers are 
									lower than observed during the first campaign. In the end, 52 accessible sites were selected: 31 river/stream sites 
									and 21 reservoir sites.</p>

								<header>
									<h3>Abiotic conditions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>	We collected information on the abiotic conditions in each of the 52 sampling sites. To get this data, we made use of a multiprobe 
									(a device that measures several conditions at once) <i>on-site</i> and USEPA approved test kits to determine the nutrient concentrations
									<i>off-site</i>. The collection of this data resulted in some interesting patterns that contrasted the findings of the first campaign. For 
									instance, ammonium and nitrite concentrations directly downstream of the city of Cuenca (site CU03, followed by CU02 and PA01) were almost 
									ten times higher than what we observed in July/August. Also orthophosphate concentrations were clearly higher than before. It is not 
									unthinkable that the extreme drought played a role in these excessive nutrient levels. Equally interesting is the decreasing nutrient 
									levels in the downstream direction, which shows that the Paute river system is able to recover from a signicant pollution event. </p>

									<h3>Summary</h3>
								</header>
								<p> A total of 52 sampling sites were selected and assessed for a variety of water quality parameters. The abiotic conditions showed a clear contrast
									with the first campaign, with extremely high nutrient levels directly downstream of the city of Cuenca. </p>

									More information can be found in the short report on the second sampling campaign [<a href="../reports.html">link</a>].

									<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

								<p> We would like to thank K.P. Ramirez Pozo for their help in collecting the samples in the field as well as their subsequent processing in the lab. 
									We also thank D.G. Zuñiga Villegas for providing us with the necessary transport.</p>
