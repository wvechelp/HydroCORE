									<h1>Campaign #8</h1>
									<p>April 2025</p>

								On Monday 07 April, we headed out to the field for the first day of the eighth (and final) campaign. By now, the experience of 
								the previous campaigns came in handy to access the selected sampling sites and organise the logistics of the field visits. 
								The rainfall continued to be at normal levels and has had a clear impact on the water levels in the rivers, while 
								the reservoirs were completely full. In the end, 53 accessible sites were selected: 31 river/stream sites and 22 reservoir sites.</p>

									<h3>Abiotic conditions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>	We collected information on the abiotic conditions in each of the 53 sampling sites. To get this data, we made use of a multiprobe 
									(a device that measures several conditions at once) <i>on-site</i> and USEPA approved test kits to determine the nutrient concentrations
									<i>off-site</i>. The collection of this data confirmed the patterns of the previous campaigns and are in line with what we expected. For 
									instance, ammonium and nitrite concentrations directly downstream of the city of Cuenca (site CU03, followed by CU02 and PA01) were lower
									than most of the previous campaigns. It is highly likely that the daily rainfall events (since the end of December) have had a cleaning
									effect on the rivers, as well as a diluting effect of any incoming wastewaters. Equally interesting is the decreasing nutrient levels 
									in the downstream direction, which shows that the Paute river system is able to recover from a signicant pollution event. </p>

									<h3>Summary</h3>
								</header>
								<p> A total of 53 sampling sites were selected and assessed for a variety of water quality parameters. The abiotic conditions showed a 
									clear similarity with the previous campaigns, with slightly higher nutrient levels directly downstream of the city of Cuenca. </p>

									More information can be found in the short report on the eighth sampling campaign [<a href="../reports.html">link</a>].
