									<h1>Campaign #5</h1>
									<p>July-August 2024</p>
								</header>

									On Monday 22 July, we headed out to the field for the first day of the fifth campaign. By now, the experience of 
									the previous campaigns came in handy to access the selected sampling sites and organise the logistics of the field visits. 
									The dry season has had a clear impact on the water levels in the rivers, while the reservoirs seemed to have recovered well 
									from the drought in the previous months. In the end, 52 accessible sites were selected: 31 river/stream sites 
									and 21 reservoir sites.</p>
							
									<header>
										<h3>Abiotic conditions</h3>
									</header>
									<p>	We collected information on the abiotic conditions in each of the 53 sampling sites. To get this data, we made use of a multiprobe 
										(a device that measures several conditions at once) <i>on-site</i> and USEPA approved test kits to determine the nutrient concentrations
										<i>off-site</i>. The collection of this data confirmed the patterns of the previous campaigns and are in line with what we expected. For 
										instance, ammonium and nitrite concentrations directly downstream of the city of Cuenca (site CU03, followed by CU02 and PA01) were almost 
										ten times higher than what we observed in July/August. Also orthophosphate concentrations were clearly higher than before. It is not 
										unthinkable that the extreme drought played a role in these excessive nutrient levels. Equally interesting is the decreasing nutrient 
										levels in the downstream direction, which shows that the Paute river system is able to recover from a signicant pollution event. </p>

										<h3>Summary</h3>
									</header>
									<p> A total of 52 sampling sites were selected and assessed for a variety of water quality parameters. The abiotic conditions showed a clear similarity
										with the previous campaigns, with clearly higher nutrient levels directly downstream of the city of Cuenca. </p>

										More information can be found in the short report on the fifth sampling campaign [<a href="../reports.html">link</a>].
