								<h2>Greenhouse gas emissions</h2>
							</header>
							<p> Earth's atmosphere is a dynamic mixture of gases that consists of approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The remaining 1% is a mixture of 
								neutral gases (e.g., argon, neon, helium, hydrogen, …) and a variety of greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane 
								(CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), …). As suggested by their name, these greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat by absorbing infrared 
								radiation (e.g., from the sun) and re-radiating it back toward the planet's surface. This intensifies the natural greenhouse effect and plays a 
								crucial role in both weather and climate systems. </p>
							<p> Emissions of greenhouse gases occur primarily through human activities. Burning of fossil fuels for transport or electricity generation plays 
								an important role, as well as the huge variety of industrial processes and livestock agriculture. In addition, also natural processes contribute 
								to the total emission of greenhouse gases. Examples include the thawing of the permafrost and the anoxic degradation of organic matter in deep 
								freshwater lakes, as well as wildfires and volcanic activities. In this regard, it is also important to note that human activities have the 
								potential to affect both the rate and the quantity of these natural greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
							<p> Within the HydroCORE project, we are interested in the emissions of greenhouse gases generated by the two reservoirs that are present in our 
								study area. We are especially interested in how these emissions relate to the emissions generated by the surrounding river systems and how they 
								are influenced by seasonal differences. In order to make statements about these conditions, we will make use of data collected in the field and 
								through remote sensing. </p>

								<h3>Data</h3>
							</header>
							<p> We identify two main sources of data for the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions: (1) field data and (2) satellite-based data. First of all, <b>field data</b> 
								reflects real-world conditions with unmatched accuracy as it is collected directly from the source. Within the HydroCORE project, eight sampling campaigns have 
								been conducted to gather information on greenhouse gas emissions and their spatiotemporal variability. In addition, samples were also collected to determine the 
								presence of these greenhouse gases dissolved within the water column. More information on the fieldwork itself and on the eight individual campaigns can be found 
								<a href="fieldwork.html" target="_blank">here</a>, while more specific information can be found on the pages dedicated to the <a href="emissions/dissolved.html" 
								target="_blank">dissolved greenhouse gases</a> and the <a href="emissions/emitted.html" target="_blank">emitted greenhouse gases</a>.</p>
							<p> Secondly, <b>satellite-based data</b> is useful to extend the field-based findings to a wider scale (both spatial and temporal). Prior to such extension, these 
								data series require ground-truthing to ensure their accuracy and reliability. After all, there might be a gap between what satellites think they observe and 
								what is actually happening. More information on this second category of data will be added soon.</p>
