									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>Hydroelectric power is a popular alternative to burning fossil fuels, especially within the Amazon river basin. However, no single
										hydropower installation is without any environmental impact. By damming a river, significant alterations do occur in the hydrological
										connectivity, which reverberate in the river's morphological state and physicochemical conditions. Moreover, consequent changes in
										the structure and functioning of the aquatic community have a tendency to negatively affect various ecosystem services, thereby
										putting local societies at risk and undermining the goal of sustainable development. Various qualitative global assessments have
										certainly helped illustrating opportunities and threats, but have failed to be compatible with local management needs and ecological
										perspectives. </p>
									<p>Therefore, the aim of this research is to monitor, analyse, evaluate and illustrate the impacts of reservoir-based
										hydropower infrastructure on the morphology, hydrology and quality of Andean headwaters within the Amazon river basin by
										combining (i) remote sensing, (ii) process-based hydrological modelling and (iii) water quality assessment based on field campaigns
										with a high temporal resolution. Additional focus is directed at the interaction with climate change, including the contribution
										through emissions of greenhouse gases (field measurements) and the challenges under future climate conditions (modelling). </p>
									<p>To do so, the Paute river basin (Ecuador) is selected as study area to (i) overcome the local data scarcity, (ii) develop a protocol for evaluating
										similar systems and (iii) preserve the uniqueness of these headwater ecosystems. Project activities and obtained results will be
										publicly accessible and continuously disseminated online and in-person. As such, this research will increase local and global
										understanding of and reduce the environmental impacts associated with reservoir-based hydropower installations.</p>
									<h2>Objectives</h2>
									<p>The HydroCORE project proposes an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to assess the local and global environmental 
										effects of Andean reservoir-based hydropower infrastructure and to develop more sustainable operating principles, 
										based on the Paute river basin as case study. These insights are crucial to influence the prevailing operating principles 
										and the mitigating measures to reduce environmental impacts under current and future climate conditions. 
										To reach this goal, the HydroCORE project includes the following research objectives (ROs):
										<ul>
											<li>Analyse, evaluate and map the local environmental impact of hydropower infrastructure;</li>
											<li>Monitor and evaluate the contribution of hydropower reservoirs to the global climate change crisis;</li>
											<li>Define optimal operating principles to limit hydrological stress under current and future climates.</li>
										</ul>
